Overview

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe (or Xs and Os) game built using Java and the Swing GUI framework. The game provides a graphical interface where two players can take turns marking their spots on a 3x3 grid. The game detects wins, ties, and provides an option to restart once the game ends.
